# Booki
This is the second project of the "Web Developer" training program at OpenClassroom. The goal of this project is to integrate a responsive HTML and CSS mockup of the Booki website, a tool for vacation planning, booking accommodations, and activities in the city of their choice.

## Site Features

• Users can search for accommodations in their preferred city using the search field, although the search button is not functional at this stage.            
• Each accommodation or activity card is clickable, and links will be added in future versions.                         
• The filters are non-functional but will change appearance on hover.                                  
• The "Accommodations" and "Activities" links in the menu are anchors that should lead to sections of the page.

## Technical Constraints

• The site should be responsive for desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.                            
• Font Awesome library provides the icons, and the color scheme includes blue #0065FC, its lighter version #DEEBFF, and #F2F2F2 for the bg.                 
• Raleway is the site's font.                                          
• CSS frameworks or pre-compilers are not allowed, and Visual Studio Code, Live Server or Prettier plugins should be used.                          
• Font Awesome icons should be integrated into HTML or CSS.                              
• Semantic tags must be used, and there should be no errors or warnings in the W3C HTML and CSS validator.                           
• The site should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.                           
• HTML and CSS should be separated and organized in the rendering folder.                               
• Git versioning should be used, and the site deployed on GitHub Pages or GitLab page.
