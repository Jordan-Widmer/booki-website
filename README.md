# Booki
This is the second project of the "Web Developer" training program at OpenClassroom. The goal of this project is to integrate a responsive HTML and CSS mockup of the Booki website, a tool for vacation planning, booking accommodations, and activities in the city of their choice.

## Site Features
• Users will be able to search for accommodations in the city of their choice. The search field is therefore an input field, the text of which can be edited by the user. However, at this stage, the search button will not be functional.

• Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable in its entirety. For now, the links will be empty.

• The filters will not be functional for this version, however, they must change appearance on hover.

• In the menu, the links "Accommodations" and "Activities" are anchors that should lead to sections of the page.

## Technical Constraints
• Two mockups: one for desktop and one for mobile. The site should also be adapted for tablets.

• Choose the most suitable format based on resolution and loading time.

• The icons come from the Font Awesome library. The colors of the charter are blue #0065FC, and its lighter version #DEEBFF, as well as gray for the background #F2F2F2.

• The site's font is Raleway.

• Do not use CSS frameworks or pre-compilers (use HTML and CSS)

• Use Visual Studio Code, and its Live Server or Prettier plugins...

• Integrate Font Awesome icons in HTML or CSS.

• The code must use semantic tags and must not contain any errors or warnings in the W3C HTML and CSS validator.

• The site should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.

• Separate HTML and CSS and organize the rendering folder.

• Version the code with Git and then deploy it on the GitHub Pages or GitLab page.
